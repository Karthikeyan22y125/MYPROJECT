    Chennai, originally known as Madras Patnam, was located in the province of Tondaimandalam, 
    an area lying between Pennar river of Nellore and the Pennar river of Cuddalore.<br>
    The capital of the province was Kancheepuram.<br>
    Tondaimandalam was ruled in the 2nd century A.D. by Tondaiman Ilam Tiraiyan, who was a representative of the Chola family at Kanchipuram.<br>
     It is believed that Ilam Tiraiyan must have subdued Kurumbas, the original inhabitants of the region and established his rule over Tondaimandalam.Subsequent to Ilam Tiraiyan, 
     the region seemed to have been ruled by the Chola Prince Ilam Killi.The Chola occupation of Tondaimandalam was put to an end by the 
     Andhra Satavahana incursions from the north under their King Pulumayi II.<br> 
     They appointed chieftains to look after the Kancheepuram region. <br>
     Bappaswami, who is considered as the first Pallava to rule from Kancheepuram, was himself a chieftain (of the tract round) at Kancheepuram under the Satavahana empire in the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., <br>
    The Pallavas who had so far been merely viceroys, became independent rulers of Kancheepuram and its surrounding areas.<br>
