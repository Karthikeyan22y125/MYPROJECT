    <div><p>Tamil Nadu is famous for its temples,festivals, and celebration of 
        the arts. he Hindu temples and monuments at Mamallapuram have   
        become famous tourist attractions. The tenth largest Indian state  
        by area and the sixth largest by population,Tamil Nadu is the home of 
        the Tamil people whose Tamil language—one of the longest surviving 
        classical languages in the world—is widely spoken in the state and 
        serves as its official language.The capital and largest city is Chennai.
        Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu 
        is defined by the lush Western Ghats and the semi-arid Deccan Plateau 
        in the west, the discontinuous Eastern Ghats in the north, the fertile
        Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of 
        Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at 
        the southern cape of the peninsula—Kanyakumari, and the river Kaveri 
        bisecting the state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian
        states of Kerala,Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory 
        of Puducherry,as well as an international maritime border with the 
        Northern Province  of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.Historically, Tamil 
        Nadu had beencontinuously inhabited by modern humans from 15,000 BC. 
        The at-large Tamilakam region dominated by the Tamil-speaking Dravidian
        population was under several regimes over centuries, such as the Sangam 
        era (300 BC–AD 300) rulers of the Chera, Chola, and Pandya clans,
        the Pallava dynasty (3rd–9th century), and the later Vijayanagara 
        Empire (14th–17th century), all of which shaped the state's cuisine, 
        culture, and architecture. European colonization began with establishing 
        trade ports in the 17th century, with the British controlling much of South 
        India as the Madras Presidency, an administrative province of British India. 
        After the Indian Independence in 1947, the region became the Madras State of 
        the Republic of India, and in 1956, the state borders were redrawn linguistically 
        by the States Reorganisation Act (1956) into the current shape. The state was renamed 
        as Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil Country", in 1969.
        As the most urbanised state of India, Tamil Nadu boasts an 
        economy with gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹24.85 
        lakh crore (US$310 billion), marking the second-largest economy 
        amongst the 28 states of India. It has the country's 9th-highest GSDP 
        per capita of ₹225,106 (US$2,800), and ranks 11th in human development i
        ndex. Tamil Nadu is also one of the most industrialised states, with the 
        manufacturing sector accounting for more than one-third of the state's GDP.
        Home to a number of ancient relics, historic buildings, religious pilgrimage 
        spots, hill stations, forts, and three World Heritage Sites, 
        Tamil Nadu's tourism industry is the largest among the Indian states.
         15% of Tamil Nadu's forests are protected areas, hosting diverse wildlife. 
        The Tamil film industry, nicknamed as Kollywood, plays an influential role in the state's popular culture.</p>
