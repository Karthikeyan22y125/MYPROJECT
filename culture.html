    <p>
      The culture of Tamil Nadu is a blend of ancient <br>traditions, art, music, and literature<br>
      Tamils have strong attachment to the Tamil language,<br>
      which is often venerated in literature as Tamil̲an̲n̲ai,<br> 
      "the Tamil mother".It has historically been, and to <br>large
      extent still is, central to the Tamil identity.It is a<br>
      Dravidian language, with little relation to the <br>Indo-European
      languages of northern India. The<br> languagehas been far 
      less influenced by Sanskrit than <br>the other Dravidian 
      languages, and preserves many <br>features of Proto-Dravidian,
      though modern-day spoken <br>Tamil in Tamil Nadu freely 
      uses loanwords from <br>Sanskrit and English. Tamil literature 
      is of considerable antiquity, <br>and underpins the decision to 
      recognize Tamil as a classical language by the government of India.
      Classical Tamil literature, which ranges from lyric poetry to works 
      on poetics and ethical philosophy, is remarkably different from 
      contemporary and later literature in other Indian languages,
      and represents the oldest body of secular literature in South Asia</p>
